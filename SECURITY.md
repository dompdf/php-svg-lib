# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Because of limited resources and general compatibility 
between versions only the [latest release](https://github.com/dompdf/php-svg-lib/releases) of Dompdf 
is actively supported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

In order to give the community time to respond and patch 
we strongly urge you report all security issues privately. 
New vulnerabilities can be reported through the GitHub
[Security Advisories](https://github.com/dompdf/php-svg-lib/security/advisories) 
feature. If you have any questions email us at security@dompdf.org and 
we will respond ASAP.
